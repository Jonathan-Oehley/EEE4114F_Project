# EEE4114F Term Project - UCT
### Neural Networks Applied to Position Estimation from Stereoscopic Images
### Using a Leap Motion Controller

The aim of this project was to develop a neural network capable of predicting the position (x,y,z) of fingertips in a pair of stereoscopic images. These images were obtained from a Leap Motion Controller, and a sample dataset is provided in this repository.

Two approaches were investigated: SVR & CNN

## Support Vector Regression Implementation
The files and code used to generate the SVR models is included in this repository.

## Convolutional Neural Network Implementation
The Google Colab notebooks used for this investigation are included in this repository.
